# Arbitrum Sybil Detection

This project aims to remove Sybil addresses from the Arbitrum airdrop, ensuring that only legitimate users receive the airdrop tokens.

## Methodology

We use on-chain data to identify related addresses owned by the same user and remove entity addresses such as bridges, exchanges, and smart contracts using data from Nansen, Hop, and OffChain Labs. There are also some addresses being removed by manual inspection such as donation addresses.

With those cleaned up, 2 graphs are generated for this study:

Graph 1: In this graph, each transaction with msg.value is treated as an edge with their (from_address, to_address)

Graph 2: In this graph, each funder/sweep transaction is treated as an edge with their (from_address, to_address)

  - **funder transaction** is the first ether transfer to an account
  - **sweep transaction** is the last ether transfer from an account

## Sybil Cluster Identification

Clusters are generated by partioning the above graphs into strongly connected and weakly connected subgraphs. Large subgraphs are broken down using the Louvain Community Detection Algorithm, providing more refined results and eliminating Sybil addresses more accurately.

We identify Sybil clusters based on known patterns, here are some examples

- Addresses transfering funds in a cluster of more than 20 addresses
- Addresses that are funded from the same source
- Addresses with similar activity
